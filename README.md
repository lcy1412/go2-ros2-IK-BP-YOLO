# This project contains two parts: Raspberry Pi (pi_code) + Go2 (others)
Pi is for controling xArm 2.0 to grasp apples which are identified by YOLOv8
Go2 is for mapping and navigation

# 1.Unitree Go2 ROS 2 Workspace

## Introduction
This repository hosts the code and resources for integrating the Unitree Go2 robot with ROS 2. The Unitree Go2 brings advanced robotics technology to your fingertips, and with this workspace, you can leverage its full potential within the ROS 2 ecosystem.

## Requirements
- **ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy** or higher
- **Ubuntu 20.04** (recommended)
- Unitree Go2 robot

## Installation

1. Install Official Unitree ROS2 Package
First, install the official Unitree ROS2 package:

# Follow the official installation guide
# https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2
2. Install Dependencies
ROS2 Packages
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-navigation2 \
                     ros-foxy-nav2-bringup \
                     ros-foxy-pcl-ros \
                     ros-foxy-tf-transformations \
                     ros-foxy-slam-toolbox
3. Build the Workspace
# Create workspace
mkdir -p go2_ros2_ws/src
cd go2_ros2_ws/src

# Clone repository
